## Description
In this module, code is being implemented to create a server which will use routes to access a JSON database being stored as a file. A more refined file structure was also introduced to accomodate for coding a server, and how traffic can be managed through the use of Router.

Many key concepts were introduced in this module, such as what is a query and a parameter, their purpose, and how to use them. Middleware was also explained along with its purpose, and the use of Insomnia and how the database can be accessed during a testing stage without implementing a front-end. Modularization of api routes was also taught.

Finally, the module gave an insight as to a possible situation from a work-place environment where as a Full Stack Developer, we may have to build a server from scratch (such as in this module) and be given front end code which we then have to connect and ensure all functionality is in tact.

This project is also deployed on [heroku](https://whispering-castle-66997.herokuapp.com/)
